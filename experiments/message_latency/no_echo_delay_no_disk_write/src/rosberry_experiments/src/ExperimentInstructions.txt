Steps needed to run message latency experiments under ROS for a pair of robots:

1. Check that you are connected to the network RaspberryNetwork. The password is "raspberry".

2. Associate the IP addresses of each robot with a hostname, by modifying the /etc/hosts file of your machine. The IP addresses are labelled on each robot. Alternatively, just use the IP addresses directly. Example hosts file:

	::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
	fe00::0 ip6-localnet
	ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
	ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
	ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

	192.168.2.10	masterpi
	192.168.2.102	mercurypi
	192.168.2.104	venuspi
	192.168.2.106	terrapi
	192.168.2.108	marspi
	192.168.2.110	jupiterpi
	192.168.2.112	saturnpi
	192.168.2.114	uranuspi
	192.168.2.116	neptunepi
	192.168.2.118	plutopi

3. Boot up robots. They need maybe 30 or so seconds to start up once you put in the batteries.

4. Using separate terminals, ssh into the robot pair you want to use in the experiment, by logging in as user pi with password "raspberry". Example:

	ssh pi@masterpi
	ssh pi@mercurypi

5. Navigate to the main ROS workspace on each robot:

	cd $ROSBERRY_EXPERIMENTS

6. Choose which robot will set the timestamps and record the measurements and which robot will simply ping back the messages. On the measurement robot, make sure the script test_latency_main.py exists. On the pingback robot, make sure the script test_latency_echo.py exists. These scripts can be found in the repository, under:
	/al-internship/ROSberry_Experiments/rosberry_experiments/src/Line_Formation/Experiments/Scalability/NetworkTraffic

7. Choose one of the robots to host the master (if not using a seprate master), open a separate ssh terminal to it and run:

		roscore

	This will start the ROS master service.

8. If you started a master on one of the experiment robots like in step 4, then, on the other robot, run:

	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://**name_of_master**:11311/

	**name_of_master** should be replaced with the hostname of the machine on which you ran "roscore" (e.g. masterpi). This will tell the other robot where to find the master.

9. Going back to your initial robot terminals, on the pingback/echo robot run:

	rosrun rosberry_experiment test_latency_echo.py

	Then, on the main robot, run:

	rosrun rosberry_experiments no_echo_delay_no_disk_write.sh

10. Wait until the script running on the main robot exits and then Ctrl+C the script on the other robot if no longer needed (it will otherwise continue listening for messages and passing them back at the set rate).

11. Run "ls" on the main robot. There should now be a file titled results.csv. This contains N lines - corresponding to each of the N messages -, where each line is composed of:

	ID(int),SendTime(float),RecvTime(float)

	SendTime and RecvTime are Unix time values and thus represent the seconds (+fractions of a second to a two-decimal precision) that have passed since the start of the Unix epoch.

Notes:
	* Make sure you save or copy the times_RATE.txt files before re-running the experiment with the same rate value, as the old values will be overwritten.
	* You can copy over files from the robots to your machine by opening a terminal on your machine and running scp, like in the example:

		scp pi@masterpi:/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/rosberry_experiments/src/times_3.txt ./

	* The main script will by default sleep for 5 seconds after the last message was sent and only then exit, to make sure the subscriber (which runs in a separate thread) has more than enough time to receive any messages that are still inbound.
